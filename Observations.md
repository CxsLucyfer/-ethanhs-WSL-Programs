# List of interesting things found while testing.
---------------------------------------------------
Please sort issues into the three categories. Major issues are ones that break the system. Moderate are issues that
are a problem and more than an inconvenience. Minor issues are more quirks that dont appear to have serious 
repercussions.

## Major Issues
---------------

## Moderate Issues
------------------
- Window resizing: (changing the side of the window that contains bash)
  - Moves focus far from cursor line
  - Text scrolling breaks if done

## Minor Issues
---------------
- Common keyboard shortcuts like `Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+V` do not work
  directly on bash window. You can access command like copy & paste by
  right-clicking on the title bar > edit > choose command. It is also
  possible to use `Enter` for copy and right mouse button for paste.
